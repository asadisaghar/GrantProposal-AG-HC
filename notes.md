## Arguments
- IMBHs are important
- One promissing way to probe them is compound lensing (Zackrisson&Riehm Review)
- We have run simulations on their detection limits with currently-online interferometry arrays (EZ+2013)
- We need a few months (4-6?) to work on the data

the first detection EVER! of a IMBH via gravitational lensing
maybe experts in BHs so draw attention to the relation to BH
