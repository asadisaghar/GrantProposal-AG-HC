Astronomical observations have shown that black holes exist either as stellar-mass black holes formed from the collapse of stars, or supermassive black holes fed by the accretion of gas into the central regions of galaxies. While theoretical mechanisms for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes have been proposed, the empirical evidence for such objects has remained scant. We have singled out a gravitationally lensed quasar (B1152+199) with properties that appear consistent with our simulations of lensing by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), and were granted time with the global VLBI array to test our hypothesis. Previous maps of the system with lower angular resolution have resulted in a tentative detection of a dark compact substructure in the main lens with M~1e5-1e7 Msun, based on the jet curvature seen in one of the two macroimages in this system. We are now in possession of three unpublished data sets of the system. Our plan is to confirm the jet curvature and search for previously unresolved distortions in the curved jet to provide the first robust detection of secondary gravitational lensing by a compact dark object. Our numerical models suggest that if the peculiar appearance of this radio source is indeed due to gravitational lensing by a foreground object, then that object must have properties very similar to an IMBH. If confirmed, this would not only be the smallest gravitational lens ever discovered, but also the first case of a black hole discovered through gravitational lensing, at any mass scale.
